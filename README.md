This is a personal project where I design an 8-bit CPU with an ALU capable of performing basic mathematical operations, essentially making it a calculator.

I am designing each module separately and they will be uploaded to their own branches as I make progress on them. This includes Verilog design and verification code files.

Once completed, the top-level Verilog file will be uploaded into the 'main' branch.

The intention of this project is to have a working top-level design that can be programmed onto my DE10-nano FPGA board.

This project was inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard CPU which you can look at here (https://eater.net/8bit).
